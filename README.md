Airport Check-In System Based On Face ID

__Introduction:__

Overview: 
Paper passports consume significant time and resources during creation and are often underutilized before expiration, resulting in paper waste.
During verification, individuals may attempt to evade or bribe human counter agents, but computer systems provide a more reliable barrier. For instance, in scenarios such as a health risk like coronavirus, while a human agent might allow passage, the system would remain steadfast in its protocols.

__Architecture and Design:__

System Architecture: 
Passport Creator Software: This software will facilitate the creation of digital passport profiles. It will capture essential biographical data and images using the attached camera. The captured data will be securely stored and organized within a database for future reference.
Verifier Software: The verifier software will handle the authentication process. It will capture images of individuals seeking verification using the camera. These images will then be compared with the stored passport profiles to confirm identity.

Data Flow: 
The system will store only the user's feature vector and images from their passport and CNIC on a chip embedded within a USB device.
